1 The file explorer \n
\n
Unlike to other file explorers these one is constructed in a horizontal way with the reason of better embedment into the rest of the design.
It consists of multiple rows composited of a description of the row on the left (eg. "Volumes") and a list of objects according to these description on the right (eg. "C:/", "D:/" ...). 
Every of those lists could be scrolled sidewards. Left mouse click to dive deeper into the filestructure, right mouse click to mark/select a file/folder. \n
\n
2 Master or Slave? \n
\n
Basically the render network consists of one master-computer which operates as the head and multiple Slave-computers, whose task it is to follow the commands of their master.
A computer with the APK setup as slave will listen to commands from the one pc setup as master. 
Those commands are transmitted via a file in the cloud folder one has to choose too in the setup. \n
\n
3 The blender.exe file \n
\n
To guarantee the success of the render process, it is indispensable to set the path to the blender.exe file, which could be found in the current blender installation folder. \n
\n
4 The image folder \n
\n
Once started rendering, the software will output all rendered PNGs to a sub folder of your chosen cloud folder. After rendering the last frame, the software collects all images
and saves them to the selected image folder. \n
\n
5 The cloud folder \n
\n
As described above, the cloud folder is the connection between all computers belonging to the render network. It is recommended to create a separate cloud folder due to the 
amount of files which will be generated over time. Name the folder with a recognizable tag like "NetworkAPK" or something similar. \n
\n
6 The Blenderfile folder \n
\n
This path tells the software where to search for .blend files. Its only purpose is to optimize the workflow. \n
\n
7 PC Alias \n
\n
Every Computer need to be named with a unique tag to operate correctly in the network, to be recognized in the node editor and to create its own data structure. \n
